the employees’ last names. Rewrite the query so that the user is prompted to enter a letter that the last name starts
with. For example, if the user enters “H” (capitalized) when prompted for a letter, then the
output should show all employees whose last name starts with the letter “H.”
Modify the query such that the case of the entered letter does not affect the output. The
entered letter must be capitalized before being processed by the SELECT query. */
